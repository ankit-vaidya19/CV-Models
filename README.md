# cv_models

This repository contains implementation of basic CV models using TensorFLow and Keras

All models are trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset that has 10 image classes of 32x32 rgb images

The implemented models are:

AlexNet: Krizhevsky, Alex; Sutskever, Ilya; Hinton, Geoffrey E. (2017-05-24). "ImageNet classification with deep convolutional neural networks"

VGG16: Simonyan, K. and Zisserman, A. (2015) Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large-Scale Image Recognition. The 3rd International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR2015)

ResNet50: K. He, X. Zhang, S. Ren and J. Sun, "Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition," 2016 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)
